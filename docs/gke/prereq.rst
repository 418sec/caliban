GKE Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few prerequisites for creating and submitting jobs to a gke cluster.

Required Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create and use a GKE cluster, you'll need to modify your service account key
to give it Account Owner permissions. Those instructions live here:
http://go/bs-cloud#modifying-service-account-permissions. Note that this only
applies if you are using a service account key.
